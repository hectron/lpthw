# Hector's Journey Through Learn Python the Hard Way

This is a simple attempt at learning python. I had already completed CodeAcademy's track, and wanted to take on a more difficult approach.

After this, there are a variety of different projects which I wish to take on.

## What's on my learning agenda
+ Django
+ MongoDB
+ Game Development
+ Application Development
